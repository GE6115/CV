        <p>My name is Garrett Eugair. I'm entering the final semester of my college career at NVU Johnson. I'm taking this class because I needed extra credit in anything and design has always piqued my intrest. My background in art is a little
          eclectic,
          when I was younger I liked to draw a lot, but these days I more into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyDlUIec2B9VLSGcycfcoaQ">video production</a> and editing. I'm most interested in film with a capital F. I'm a huge fan of auteur
          filmmakers and the fruits of their labor. My all-time favorite would have to
          be the films of David Lynch, who incidentally and somewhat relevant to this class, was a visual artist as well as a filmmaker. In this class, I hope to have a better understanding of why we find images and designs appealing. There's always
          been
          this mystique behind design for me, you can tell when good design is at work but it's hard to articulate why something is good. I would like to be able to explain to somebody how something does or does not work. I've had some experience
          with
          photoshop and illustrator but none with GIMP. I'd say I'm slightly above absolute beginner in terms of proficiency. </p>
